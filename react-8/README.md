# Swiggy Restaurants Viewer

This is a simple React application to view and search for restaurants using Swiggy's API.

## Overview

The application consists of a Header, Body, and Footer. The main functionality lies in the Body component, where users can search for restaurants. The application fetches restaurant data from the Swiggy API, filters it, and then displays it in the form of restaurant cards.

## Features

- **Search Bar**: Enables users to search for a specific restaurant.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Filters restaurant data based on the user's search input.
- **Shimmer Effect**: A shimmer effect is displayed until the restaurant data is fetched.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message if the entered restaurant is not found.

## Components

- **Header**: Represents the topmost section of the application.
- **Body**: Contains the search functionality and the display of restaurant cards.
- **Footer**: Represents the bottommost section of the application.
- **RestaurantCard**: Displays individual restaurant details.
- **Shimmer**: A placeholder component that mimics the content layout and displays a shimmer effect until the content is loaded.
